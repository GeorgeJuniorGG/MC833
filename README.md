# MC833 - Network Laboratory

Welcome to the **MC833 Network Laboratory** repository! This repository contains implementations of **TCP** and **UDP** sockets, developed as part of the course. The code is designed to help understand and experiment with socket programming concepts.

---

## 📁 Folder Structure
- **[`TCP_socket/`](./TCP_socket/)**: Contains the implementation of a **TCP socket**, along with a `Makefile` to compile the code.
- **[`UDP_socket/`](./UDP_socket/)**: Contains the implementation of a **UDP socket**, along with a `Makefile` for compilation.

---

## 🛠️ Requirements
- **SQLite**: The implementations use SQLite for data handling. Ensure that SQLite is installed on your system before running the programs.
- **C Compiler**: A C compiler (e.g., `gcc`) is required to compile the code using the provided `Makefile`.
